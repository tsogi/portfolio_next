<p className='_message'>Nika started with visualization work and ended leading a team that delivered the critical engineering milestone in our software product cycle. He did this for a complex hardware product using a distributed team, a level of complexity that has humbled other developers. Nika rose to the occasion and we look forward to working together again</p>
